Dataset Description:
The Conversational Sarcasm Corpus (CSC)
The CSC is a dataset of sarcasm that provides ~7,000 context+response pairs, sarcasm ratings from 1 to 6 both by the response generators (speakers), and by multiple external observers per pair (6 in part1, 4 in part2). It is the result of multiple online experiments, in which the first batch of participants (speakers, generators) responded to given contexts (situation descriptions involving an imaginary interlocutor), and provided sarcasm ratings to their own responses from 1 (not at all) to 6 (completely). In the subsequent experiments, a new batch of participants (observers, evaluators) provided sarcasm ratings to the speakers' responses from 1 to 6. Multiple observers evaluated each context+response pair (each row in the dataset), where 6 observers evaluated the same row for part1, and 4 observers for part2.

Task:
Your task is to estimate the distribution of labels that human annotators will assign in their task.

Format:
Output the probability of each label as a JSON object like this:

{{ '1': p1, '2': p2, '3': p3, '4': p4, '5': p5, '6': p6 }}
