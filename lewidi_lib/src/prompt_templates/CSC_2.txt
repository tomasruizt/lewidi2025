# Task
Below is a context+response pair where human annotators rated the sarcasm level of the 'response' ranging from 1 (not at all) to 6 (completely). Please guess the distribution of ratings and output it in JSON format like this: {{'0': p0, '1': p1, '2': p2, '3': p3, '4': p4, '5': p5, '6': p6}}, where each p0, ..., p6 is a probability. Note that p0 is always 0.0 because the rating 0 is not allowed. The sum of probabilities must equal 1.0.
