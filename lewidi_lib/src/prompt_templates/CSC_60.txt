[Instructions]

Solve the task below. Format your response into logical steps that can be verified by a third-party, and format each step in JSON format like this:

{{
    'steps': [
        '<text of step 1>',
        '<text of step 2>',
        ...,
        '<text of step n>'
    ],
    'final_response': '<response>'
}}

Please simplify your final response as much as possible, and avoid any unnecessary text there.

[Task]

Below is a context+response pair where human annotators rated the sarcasm level of the 'response' ranging from 1 (not at all) to 6 (completely). Please guess the distribution of ratings and output it in the final_response field in JSON format like this: {{'0': p0, '1': p1, '2': p2, '3': p3, '4': p4, '5': p5, '6': p6}}, where each p0, ..., p6 is a probability. Note that p0 is always 0.0 because the rating 0 is not allowed. The sum of probabilities must equal 1.0.

Use this definition for sarcasm: "The use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way"

Think about the perspectives that different annotators might have and how they could potentially interpret the context+response pair.
