# Dataset Description:
The MultiPico dataset (MP)
The MP dataset is a multilingual perspectivist corpus consisting of short exchanges from Twitter and Reddit. Each entry in the corpus represents a post-reply pair. Crowdsourced workers had to determine whether the reply was ironic given the post (binary label). The corpus includes 11 languages: Arabic, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. It also contains sociodemographic information about the annotators, including gender, age, nationality, race, and student or employment status. While the statistics may vary slightly across languages, each post-reply pair is typically annotated by an average of 5 workers.

# Task:
You are given a single example from the dataset, not the full dataset.
Your task is to estimate the fraction of annotators that selected each label for this example.
In other words, estimate the distribution of annotations for this example.

# Constraints:
Output the fractions / probabilities in JSON format like below. 

{{ "0": p0, "1": p1 }}

Where p1, ..., pX are fractions / probabilities between 0 and 1, and their sum equals 1.
