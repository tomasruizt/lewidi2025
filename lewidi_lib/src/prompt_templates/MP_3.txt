# Task
Below is a post-reply pair where human annotators rated the irony of the 'reply' as either 0.0 (not ironic) or 1 (ironic). Please guess the distribution of ratings and output it in JSON format like this: {{'0': p0, '1': p1}}, where p0 and p1 are probabilities. The sum of probabilities must equal 1.0.

Use this definition for irony: "A situation in which something which was intended to have a particular result has the opposite or a very different result"
