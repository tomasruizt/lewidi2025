[Instructions]

Solve the task below. Format your response into logical steps that can be verified by a third-party, and format each step in JSON format like this:

{{
    'steps': [
        '<text of step 1>',
        '<text of step 2>',
        ...,
        '<text of step n>'
    ],
    'final_response': '<response>'
}}

Please simplify your final response as much as possible, and avoid any unnecessary text there.

[Task]

Below is a post-reply pair where human annotators rated the irony of the 'reply' as either 0 (not ironic) or 1 (ironic). Please guess the rating given by each annotator and output them all in a list in the final_response field, in the same order as the annotators.

Use this definition for irony: "a situation in which something which was intended to have a particular result has the opposite or a very different result"

Think about the perspectives that different annotators might have and how they could potentially interpret the post-reply pair.
