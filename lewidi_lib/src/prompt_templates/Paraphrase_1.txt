# Dataset Description:
The Paraphrase Detection dataset (Par)
Four annotators independently annotated 500 question pairs from the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, assigning a Likert scale score from -5 to 5 to indicate how strongly the questions are paraphrases of one another. Each annotator also provided a short explanation for their score. This dataset uses scalar labels and limits each annotator to a single score per item.

# Task:
You are given a single example from the dataset, not the full dataset.
Your task is to estimate the fraction of annotators that selected each label for this example.
In other words, estimate the distribution of annotations for this example.

# Constraints:
Output the fractions / probabilities in JSON format like below. 

{{ "-5": p0, "-4": p1, "-3": p2, "-2": p3, "-1": p4, "0": p5, "1": p6, "2": p7, "3": p8, "4": p9, "5": p10 }}

Where p0, ..., pX are fractions / probabilities between 0 and 1, and their sum equals 1.
