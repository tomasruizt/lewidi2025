# Task

Below is a pair of questions where human annotators rated how strongly the questions are paraphrases of one another on a Likert scale score from -5 to 5. Please guess the rating given by each annotator and output them all in a list, in the same order as the annotators.

Think about the perspectives that different annotators might have and how they could potentially interpret the pair of questions.
