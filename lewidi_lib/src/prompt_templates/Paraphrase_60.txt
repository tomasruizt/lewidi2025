[Instructions]

Solve the task below. Format your response into logical steps that can be verified by a third-party, and format each step in JSON format like this:

{{
    'steps': [
        '<text of step 1>',
        '<text of step 2>',
        ...,
        '<text of step n>'
    ],
    'final_response': '<response>'
}}

Please simplify your final response as much as possible, and avoid any unnecessary text there.

[Task]

Below is a pair of questions where human annotators rated how strongly the questions are paraphrases of one another on a Likert scale score from -5 to 5. Please guess the distribution of ratings and output it in the final_response field in JSON format like this: {{ "-5": p0, "-4": p1, "-3": p2, "-2": p3, "-1": p4, "0": p5, "1": p6, "2": p7, "3": p8, "4": p9, "5": p10 }}, where p0 to p10 are probabilities. The sum of probabilities must equal 1.0.

Think about the perspectives that different annotators might have and how they could potentially interpret the pair of questions.
