# Task

Below is a natural language inference (NLI) task where human annotators labeled if the "statement" followed from the "context". They labeled each category (entailment, neutral, contradiction) separately as either 0 (present) or 1 (absent). Please guess for each category the label given by each annotator and output them all in a list, in the same order as the annotators. For example, for 4 annotators:

{{ "entailment": [0, 1, 0, 1], "neutral": [1, 0, 1, 0], "contradiction": [0, 0, 0, 1] }}

Think about the perspectives that different annotators might have and how they could potentially interpret the NLI task.
