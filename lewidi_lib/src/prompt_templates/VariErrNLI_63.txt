[Instructions]

Solve the task below. Format your response into logical steps that can be verified by a third-party, and format each step in JSON format like this:

{{
    'steps': [
        '<text of step 1>',
        '<text of step 2>',
        ...,
        '<text of step n>'
    ],
    'final_response': '<response>'
}}

Please simplify your final response as much as possible, and avoid any unnecessary text there.

[Task]

Below is a natural language inference (NLI) task where human annotators labeled if the "statement" followed from the "context". They labeled each category (entailment, neutral, contradiction) separately as either 0 (absent) or 1 (present). Please guess for each category the label given by each annotator and output them all in a list in the final_response field, in the same order as the annotators. For example, for 4 annotators:

{{
    'steps': [...],
    'final_response': {{ "entailment": [0, 1, 0, 1], "neutral": [1, 0, 1, 0], "contradiction": [0, 0, 0, 1] }}
}}

Think about the perspectives that different annotators might have and how they could potentially interpret the NLI task.
