# Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Evaluation

## Overview
Your goal is to grade an LLM's step-by-step solution to a problem. The model will often say
things that look ok at first, but will turn out to be wrong on closer inspection - stay vigilant!
Please mark each step with (great, okay, bad).

## Instructions
A "great" step is anything a smart student would try. 
Most of the time it's a clear cut step forward towards solving the problem. But it
could also be a sub-optimal choice, as long as it looks like something a reasonably smart
human might say while trying to solve the problem. An "okay" step is anything that's
reasonable for a person to say, but it's not offering any insight, doesn't further the solution
by exploring an option, performing a calculation, or offering an idea for the next step. A
"bad" step is one that confidently says something incorrect, is off-topic/weird, leads
the solution into a clear dead-end, or is not explained clearly enough for a human to follow
along with (even if it is correct).

## Output Format
Only output the step text and the rating, like this example below.
[
    {{"text": "step text", "rating": "great"}},
    {{"text": "step text", "rating": "ok"}},
    {{"text": "step text", "rating": "bad"}},
    {{"text": "step text", "rating": "great"}}
]
Please verify that the step text is the same as in the input.
