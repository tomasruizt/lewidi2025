In CSC:
- primary metrics: abs_dist, ws_loss
- in PE: lowest abs_dist by 2b, both medians 
- In SL: Simple is best by large margin (0.1)

In Paraphrase:
- 2b beats s-s by a large margin in both tasks
- in PE: medians are best, low is sligthly better than high
- in SL: Medians are best, low is sligthly better than high. Both better than simple by wide margin (0.11)


# Multi-task learning
For the s-s model, the performance of multi-task learning is worse than single-task learning for CSC, and MP. 
Only in Paraphrase, performance is the same.

For the 2b-2b model, the performance of multi-task learning is worse for CSC, MP, and Paraphrase (all datasets)
